# Todoey

This is a to-do app that allows you to check or uncheck your tasks. Currently it doesn't save your tasks for the next time you load it, because the goal is actually to learn how to manage state, using both setState() and the Provider package, to keep information across the widget tree.  Local saving is planned to be added, though.

## Goals

- Understand what is state and why we need to manage it.
- Understand the difference between ephemeral (local) state and app state.
- See the problems with simply relying on setState().
- Learn about the concept of Prop Drilling.
- Examine various popular ways of managing app state for Flutter projects.
- Learn about the List Builder.
- Use the Flutter BottomSheet Widget.
- Learn to lift state up to be able to access it from children widgets.
- Learn about design patterns and why they are useful.
- Understand how the Provider package works and use it to manage app state.
