# Bitcoin Ticker

This is a cryptocurrency checking app using the API from [CoinAPI.io](https://www.coinapi.io/). The objective is to use Material Design or Cupertino, depending on the device used. The API is very limited, and only allows 100 accesses per day.

## Goals

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revise previous concepts by completing the challenges.
