# Flash Chat

This is an instant messaging app. It actually only has one database for all messages, even if there are more than 2 users, so it can be more like a group chat app.

This app incorporates the Firebase framework to create authentication and store messages. It also uses a stream listener to update messages in real time, without having to reload the app.
